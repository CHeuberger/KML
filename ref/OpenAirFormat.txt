AIRSPACE-related record types: 
============================== 

AC  class  ; where class can be: 
  R                       restricted 
  Q                       danger 
  P                       prohibited 
  A                       Class A 
  B                       Class B 
  C                       Class C 
  D                       Class D  
  GP                      glider prohibited  
  CTR                     CTR 
  W                       Wave Window 

AN string      ;string = Airspace Name 
AH string      ;string = Airspace Ceiling 
AL string      ;string = Airspace Floor 
AT coordinate  ;coordinate = Coordinate of where to place a name label on the map (optional) 
NOTE: there can be multiple AT records for a single airspace segment 
   

TERRAIN-related record types (NYI): 
============================== 
 
TO {string}    ; Declares Terrain Open Polygon; string = name (optional) 
TC {string)    ; Declares Terrain Closed Polygon; string = name  (optional) 
SP style, width, red, green, blue    ; Selects Pen to be used in drawing 
PEN STYLES in SP command: 
       SOLID               0 
       DASH                1 
       NULL (transparent)  5 
 
Example: for a 1 pixel wide, dashed, light gray pen use: SP 0,1,192,192,192 
SB  red, green, blue ; Selects Brush Color to be used in drawing 
Example: to select white interior of a closed polygon, use: SB 255, 255, 255  
To select transparent interior use: SB -1,-1,-1 
  

Record types common to both TERRAIN and AIRSPACE 
============================== 
V x=n    ; Variable assignment. 
Currently the following variables are supported: 
D={+|-}    ;sets direction for: DA and DB records 
  ‘-‘ means counterclockwise direction; 
  ‘+’ is the default; 
  D is automatically reset to ‘+’ at the begining of new airspace segment   
X=coordinate    ; sets the center for the following records: DA, DB, and DC   
Z=number    ; makes the element invisible at zoom levels > number 
T=1    ; transparent Airspace segment (draw border only) 


DP coordinate    ;add polygon point 
DA radius, angleStart angleEnd    ; add an arc, angles in degrees, radius in nm 
DB coordinate1, coordinate2    ; add an arc, from coordinate1 to coordinate2 
DC radius    ; draw a circle (center taken from the previous V X record, radius in nm
